# glia: Infrastructure for ML workflows  

## What?
Glia is a data engineering infrastructure to enable continuous monitoring and training of machine learning (ML) models.

## Why?
Shifts in live data is a common concern for many production ML models. The ML model developers may not always have the metrics ready to help them decide when to retrain their models. Once they decide to retrain, they may not be able to incorporate new training data in their models. Glia aims to automate these tasks at scale.
